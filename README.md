# DocPen_UbiComp

This is a Pytorch implementation of DocPen test project, providing the code, weights, and test sets needed for model testing.

## Overview

This project is used to test and evaluate the performance of the DocPen model. This project contains the resources needed to run model tests, including code, pre-trained weights, and a test dataset. Since the full dataset is too large, we only provide the test dataset for quick evaluation.

### File Structure

- `model.py`: The main test script.
- `weights/`: The folder containing the model weights.
- `data/`: The folder containing the test dataset.
- `utils/`: Auxiliary tools and functions.
- `SA_ConvLSTM_Pytorch/`: Implementation of ConvLstm, modified from [SA-ConvLSTM-Pytorch](https://github.com/tsugumi-sys/SA-ConvLSTM-Pytorch.git) .

## Dataset

Since the complete dataset is too large, we only provide the test dataset. The dataset is divided as follows:

- **Proportional division**: Each author's data is divided into training data and test data in a ratio of 4:1.
- **Document independence**: The samples in the training set and the test set come from different documents to ensure the fairness of the model evaluation.

## Examples

```bash
python model.py
```

**model.py** will load the model, evaluate using the test dataset, and print the results.
